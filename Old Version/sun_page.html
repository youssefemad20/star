<p class="fact">
    Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium – at the 
    center of our solar system. It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it’s our solar system’s
    only star. Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home
<br><br>
From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light 
and heat in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. 
The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.
<br><br>
The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles 
(1.4 million kilometers). Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it.

Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival,
it’s only an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100

times larger have been found. And many solar systems have more than one star.
By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings of distant stars.

The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million °F (15 million °C). The 
part of the Sun we call its surface – the photosphere – is a relatively cool 10,000 °F (5,500 °C). 
In one of the Sun’s biggest mysteries, the Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, gets hotter the farther 
it stretches from the surface. The corona reaches up to 
3.5 million °F (2 million °C) – much, much hotter than the photosphere.

    <h2>Namesake :</h2>
</div>
    <p class="namesake">
        The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun
        god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many Sun-
        related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology.

        <h2>Potential for Life :</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="potential_for_life">
        The Sun could not harbor life as we know it because 
        of its extreme temperatures and radiation. Yet life
    on Earth is only possible because of the Sun’s light and energy.

    <div class="title_p">
        <h2>Size and Distance :</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="size">
        Our Sun is a medium-sized star with a radius of about 435,000 miles (700,000 kilometers). Many stars are much larger – but the Sun is far more massive than our home planet: it would take more than 330,000 Earths to match the mass of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun's volume.

The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) 
from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha Centauri triple star system:
 red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light-years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B – two sunlike stars orbiting each other – are 4.37 light-years away
. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which equals about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers)
