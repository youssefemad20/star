            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and is composed of various layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans, which play a crucial role in regulating climate. The planet has a diverse range of ecosystems, including forests, deserts, grasslands, and wetlands, each hosting unique flora and fauna. Earth's atmosphere, composed mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), protects life from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature. The planet experiences tectonic activity, resulting in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which shape its surface.

      <h2 class="section__header">Problems</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        One major problem is climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, leading to rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Deforestation and habitat destruction threaten biodiversity and disrupt ecosystems. Pollution, particularly plastic and chemical waste, contaminates air, water, and soil, posing health risks to humans and wildlife. Overpopulation strains resources like water, food, and energy, leading to shortages and conflicts. Natural disasters, exacerbated by climate change, such as hurricanes and floods, pose risks to human safety and infrastructure. Additionally, ocean acidification from increased carbon dioxide levels threatens marine life and fisheries.

      <h2 class="section__header">Solutions</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        To combat climate change, transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing sustainable forestry practices and protecting natural habitats can help preserve biodiversity. Reducing pollution through better waste management, recycling, and stricter regulations can improve environmental health. Promoting family planning and education can help address overpopulation and resource strain. Investing in disaster preparedness and resilient infrastructure can mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. Lastly, supporting marine conservation efforts can help protect oceans and restore marine ecosystems.
