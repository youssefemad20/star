      <h2 class="section__header">Jupiter Planet</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, classified as a gas giant. It has a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers, making it more than 11 times wider than Earth. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a thick atmosphere characterized by colorful bands of clouds, storms, and the famous Great Red Spot—a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries.

            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant, primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices. It has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers, making it the third-largest planet in the solar system. The planet's striking blue-green color is due to methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Uranus has a unique axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate almost on its side and resulting in extreme seasonal variations. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately 2.87 billion kilometers and has a rotation period of about 17.24 hours. The planet has 27 known moons and a faint ring system, adding to its intriguing characteristics.

      <h2 class="section__header">Problems</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        One significant problem is the planet’s extreme cold temperatures, which can reach around -224 degrees Celsius, making it challenging to study. The faint and poorly understood ring system could be prone to degradation over time, complicating observations. Its unique axial tilt leads to complex atmospheric dynamics and extreme seasonal changes that are not fully understood. The great distance from Earth makes Uranus less accessible for exploration, resulting in limited data and understanding of its composition. Future missions to Uranus face budget constraints and competition with other planetary exploration projects. Lastly, the understanding of its moons and ring dynamics remains incomplete, posing challenges for planetary science

      <p class="section__description">
        Investing in advanced telescopes and technology can enhance our ability to observe and analyze Uranus and its features more effectively. Utilizing atmospheric models and simulations can help scientists gain insights into the planet’s dynamics and seasonal variations. International collaboration on missions could provide the necessary funding and expertise for detailed exploration of Uranus. Developing technology for long-duration space missions could facilitate comprehensive studies of the planet and its moons. Increasing public interest and awareness about ice giants can drive funding and support for future exploratory missions. Finally, utilizing data from past missions, like Voyager 2, can improve our understanding of Uranus’s characteristics and behaviors.
