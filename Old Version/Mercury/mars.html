      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <h2 class="section__header">Mercury Planet</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. It is a rocky planet characterized by a heavily cratered surface, similar to that of the Moon, due to its lack of a substantial atmosphere and geological activity. Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with daytime temperatures reaching up to 430 degrees Celsius and plummeting to -180 degrees Celsius at night

            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. It has a rocky surface marked by craters, similar to the Moon, due to its lack of atmosphere and geological activity. Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with daytime temperatures soaring to about 430 degrees Celsius and dropping to -180 degrees Celsius at night. The planet has a very thin atmosphere composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, which cannot retain heat. Mercury orbits the Sun in about 88 Earth days and has a rotation period of about 59 Earth days, leading to a unique day-night cycle. The planet is also known for its large iron core, which generates a weak magnetic field.

      <h2 class="section__header">Problems</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        One significant problem is the extreme temperature fluctuations, which pose challenges for spacecraft that attempt to study the planet’s surface and atmosphere. The lack of a substantial atmosphere means there is no protection from solar radiation, making surface conditions harsh and inhospitable. Mercury's proximity to the Sun complicates observation from Earth, requiring advanced technology for detailed studies. The planet's geological history and potential for past volcanic activity remain poorly understood due to limited exploration. Additionally, the small size and low gravity of Mercury make landing and operating spacecraft challenging. Finally, the risk of impact from meteoroids and space debris is higher due to its exposed surface.

      <h2 class="section__header">Solutions</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        Advancements in thermal protection technologies can help design spacecraft that can withstand the extreme temperature variations on Mercury. Utilizing orbiters equipped with advanced sensors can enable remote sensing and data collection without landing on the planet's surface. Collaborative international missions could share resources and expertise to conduct more comprehensive studies of Mercury. Conducting laboratory experiments that simulate Mercury's conditions can provide insights into its geological processes and history. Developing robust landing technology can improve the success rate of missions attempting to land on Mercury. Finally, increasing public interest and investment in planetary exploration can support future missions to uncover the mysteries of this unique planet.
