                <b>Welcome to "Cubs in Space" – your gateway to exploring 
                the wonders of our solar system.<br><br> At the heart of this cosmic
                neighborhood is the Sun, a powerful star that provides light and 
                energy essential for life on Earth.<br><br> Surrounding the Sun are eight unique planets
                , each with its own characteristics, from rocky Earth to the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and the icy worlds of Uranus and Neptune.<br><br>
    
                Beyond the planets, countless smaller celestial bodies, including asteroids, comets, and moons, add
                to the complexity and beauty of our ever-changing solar system.<br><br> Explore with us!

            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. 
                All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. 
                However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>

                <p>The Sun is a star at the center of the Solar System,

                    It works through nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into energy.

                <p>Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because 
                    the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F
                    (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).

                <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only
                    planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA missions have
                    found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere
                    , billions of years ago.

                    , while the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions.
                    Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that
