          Planet Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It is part of the solar system within the Milky Way galaxy. Earth has a combination of atmosphere, liquid water, and ideal distance from the Sun that creates conditions conducive to life.

        Orbit and Seasons: Earth’s orbit around the Sun takes about 365.25 days, which defines a calendar year. The planet is tilted on its axis by 23.5 degrees, creating the seasonal variations experienced across different regions.
        
        Size and Layers: Earth has a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers, making it the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It has a layered structure:
        
        Inner Core: Solid and composed mostly of iron and nickel.
        
        Outer Core: Liquid layer surrounding the inner core.
        
        Mantle: A semi-solid rock layer responsible for tectonic plate movements, which cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
        
        Crust: The thin, solid outer layer where life exists.

        Environmental Challenges

        Human activities have led to significant environmental challenges, such as:
        
        Climate Change: The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have increased greenhouse gases, leading to global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather, and disrupted ecosystems.
        
        Pollution: Industrial and urban development has resulted in widespread pollution of air, water, and soil, impacting both the environment and human health.
        
        
        Addressing these challenges requires sustainable development and international cooperation to mitigate their effects.

        Past and Future Threats to Earth
        
        Throughout its history, Earth has faced significant threats from space:
        
        The Chicxulub Impact: Around 66 million years ago, an asteroid impact caused a mass extinction, wiping out 75% of species, including dinosaurs. The event triggered wildfires, tsunamis, and blocked sunlight, leading to an "impact winter."
        
        The Tunguska Event (1908): A large explosion in Siberia flattened 2,000 square kilometers of forest, believed to be caused by a meteor.
        
        
        Future threats include:
        
        Asteroid Collisions: Space agencies, such as NASA, are tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs) that could pose collision risks. While large impacts are rare, even small asteroids can cause regional devastation.
        
        Solar Storms: Solar flares could disrupt satellite communications, power grids, and navigation systems, potentially causing widespread chaos.
        
        Cosmic Phenomena: Rare events such as gamma-ray bursts or supernovae could expose Earth to dangerous radiation levels, though such events are highly unlikely in the near future.

      <p class="section__description">
        To safeguard against these risks, space agencies are developing strategies like asteroid deflection and early detection systems.Addressing these problems requires a collective effort from governments, communities, and individuals worldwide. By implementing sustainable practices and fostering global cooperation, we can protect Earth for future generations and ensure a healthy planet.
