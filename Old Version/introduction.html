        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>As we seek to understand the vast universe and explore the secrets of space, the importance of studying celestial bodies, especially asteroids and comets that may pose a threat to planet Earth comes. Since the beginning of space exploration, near-Earth asteroids have posed a major scientific challenge due to the potential collision risks they may pose with our planet.

            From this standpoint, this website aims to provide an interactive and innovative solution to monitor the movement of near-Earth asteroids, using modern data and resources available from space agencies such as NASA. The website displays 3D models of the movement of celestial bodies, and allows visitors to follow changes in the orbits of these bodies and the possibility of their approach to Earth.
            
            Through this system, we seek to enhance awareness and understanding of the importance of monitoring celestial bodies, and analyzing their potential impacts on planet Earth, which contributes to international efforts to protect against space disasters.
