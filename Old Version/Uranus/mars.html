            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant, primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices. It has a unique blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers, making it the third-largest planet in the solar system. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately 2.87 billion kilometers and has a rotation period of about 17.24 hours. One of its most distinctive features is its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side. Uranus has 27 known moons and a faint ring system, contributing to its complex dynamics.

      <h2 class="section__header">Problems</h2>
      <p class="section__description">
        One problem is the planet’s extreme cold temperatures, which can drop to around -224 degrees Celsius, making it challenging to study. The faint ring system is difficult to observe and could be prone to degradation over time. Additionally, the unique axial tilt leads to extreme seasonal variations, complicating our understanding of its atmospheric dynamics. The planet’s distance from Earth makes it less accessible for exploration, resulting in limited data about its composition and atmosphere. The potential for future missions to Uranus is hindered by budget constraints and the prioritization of other planetary missions. Lastly, the understanding of its moons and rings remains incomplete, presenting challenges for comprehensive planetary science

      <p class="section__description">
        Investing in advanced telescopes and space missions could enhance our ability to observe and study Uranus and its rings more effectively. Utilizing atmospheric models can help scientists better understand the planet’s dynamics and seasonal changes. Collaborative international missions may provide the necessary funding and resources to explore Uranus in greater detail. Developing technology for long-duration space missions can facilitate more comprehensive exploration of the planet and its moons. Increased public and scientific interest in ice giants can drive funding for future exploratory missions. Lastly, leveraging data from past missions, like Voyager 2, can improve our understanding of Uranus’s characteristics and behavior
